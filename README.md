# Universal Entanglement Growth After a Quantum Quench
Adrian Del Maestro, Hatem Barghathi and Bernd Rosenow

### Abstract
The time evolution of an initial  quantum state after a sudden change of interaction strength  leads to an asymptotic steady state, whose local properties are governed by the buildup of entanglement between spatial subregions of the system. Little is known about the simultaneous evolution of entanglement between groups of particles, which is based on $n$-point correlation functions.  We  analyze fermions after an interaction quantum quench in one spatial dimension and demonstrate that the steady state entropy density accumulated via entanglement dynamics is equivalent under either a spatial or particle bipartition.  Building on this connection, we  find that experimentally accessible density-density correlations can be employed to construct a  diagonal ensemble density matrix of  non-interacting bosons to compute the von Neumann entropy density, complimentary to measurements of  Renyi entropies. Our results highlight the universality of the dynamical transmutation of entanglement to thermodynamic entropy under time evolution that underlies our current framework of quantum statistical mechanics.
